# Retail Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes the sales and customer data of a fictional retail superstore to uncover actionable insights. It demonstrates the full data analysis lifecycle: from data cleaning and transformation, to SQL-based querying, and ultimately to powerful visual storytelling using Power BI dashboards.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data and derive valuable business insights. The key challenges include:
- Cleaning and preparing raw Excel data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Presenting insights through interactive and intuitive dashboards

## Solution Approach
1. *Data Cleaning: The raw dataset in Excel format was cleaned and converted into a CSV file using **Excel*.
2. *Data Transformation: Additional preprocessing was done using **Python* to ensure data consistency.
3. *Data Analysis: The cleaned CSV was imported into a **MySQL* database. SQL queries were executed to extract insights and identify sales patterns.
4. *Data Visualization: The analysis was visualized through a fully interactive **Power BI* dashboard with three key reporting pages:
   - *Sales Dashboard*
   - *Customer Analysis*
   - *Product Performance*
